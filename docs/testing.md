## Quality checks

[Back to the README](../README.md)

```bash
pytest                    # integration tests need DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL)
pytest -m "not integration"
ruff check .
black --check .
mypy
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Real-provider tests

Tests in `tests/llm/real/` call the real OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, cost
money, and are skipped by default. To run them:

```bash
RUN_REAL_PROVIDER_TESTS=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=... ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... \
  pytest -m real_provider tests/llm/real
```

Each test is also skipped if its provider key is unset. Override the models
with `OPENAI_TEST_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_TEST_MODEL`.
